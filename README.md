## H2 Description

Pupshare is a site designed for the  dog lover who wants to watch a dog but not permanently. Our site allows a Pup friend to sign up browse through a listing of dogs and pick the dogs they are interested in renting. The owners of the dogs can then review their pending request look ant the Pup friends page and decide who they would approve.  Upon approval the Pup friend is sent a approval email where they can then make arrangements with the owner to set up a time to connect.

## H2 Planned Feaatures

Eventually we would like to intergrate comments/reviews so owners can leave reviews on their Pup friends while also allowing Pup friends to leave reviews on the dogs they watch.
